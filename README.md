I'm a Year 3 student at Nanyang Technological University, currently pursuing data science and AI.  
I've tinkered with frameworks like React and Svelte, and now I'm diving into machine learning, data analytics, and Python.

🌱 Currently learning: Data Science, ML, and Python  
💡 Previously explored: React, Svelte, and full-stack development  
📊 Interests: Data visualization, predictive modeling, and reinforcement learning  
🚀 Goal: Build cool projects and become a skilled AI/Data Scientist

When I'm not coding, I enjoy self-hosting services that makes life abit better:  
- Syncthing  
- Home Assistant  
- Pi-hole  
- …and many more
